Rogue Dungeon is a short role-playing game where you go through a dungeon of multiple rooms.
You can choose what path to follow and what actions you want to complete by inputting the corresponding letter or number.
There are multiple different characters with different weapons and stats.
The weapons are made up of functions to grab the stat and place them into a vector where each location in the vector corresponds with a different stat.
The characters consist of the same structure.
The weapons are made up of categories as follows: name, weight, might, accuracy, critical chance, durability, melee, magic, and range.
The characters are made up of the categories: name, max health, strength, intelligence, speed, magic defense, physical defense, and perception.
The battles are initiated with four different classes on each side, and they battle until one entire side is dead.
Some inspiration and altered code is used from Text-Based RPG Example.
